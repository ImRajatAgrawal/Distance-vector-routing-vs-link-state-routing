# Distance-vector-routing-vs-link-state-routing
simulation of distance vector and link state routing protocol used in computer network

## Problem Definition :

write a program which will differentiate between distance vector routing and link state routing protocol .consider 'n' number of nodes/routers in a network.Make sure that the number of links are greater than n.Randomly initialize weigths for each link. For any source and destination find the shortest path chosen by DVR nad LSR.

## DESCRIPTION :
  
  > simulating the process of generating routing table for each router in the network.
	> Computing the optimal path with least cost between any two routers.
	> To find the shortest path in LSR I used the Dijkstra's algorithm.It finds the shortest path â€“ distance to all the routers,      Based on which we find the routing table and the shortest path to all destination routers.
	> To find the shortest path in DVR I used the bellmen ford algorithm.This algorithm helps a router to inform its neighbors of    topology changes periodically.
	> Each router maintains a Distance Vector table containing the distance between itself and ALL possible destination nodes  
	> A value of 999 in the input denotes  infinity i.e no direct link between two routers. 
	> check the file-name output.txt for sample test cases.
